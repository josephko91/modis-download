# MODIS Basics
"MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites ... It has a viewing swath width of 2,330 km and views the entire surface of the Earth every one to two days. Its detectors measure 36 spectral bands between 0.405 and 14.385 Âµm, and it acquires data at three spatial resolutions -- 250m, 500m, and 1,000m." ([NASA](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/))

MODIS provides numerous land, ocean, and atmosphere products. Here we will focus on **MODIS land products**, but similar procedures can likely be followed for other products. A comprehensive list of MODIS products can be found [here](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/)
