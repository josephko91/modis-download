# MODIS Basics
"MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites." ([NASA](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/))

MODIS provides numerous land, ocean, and atmosphere products. Here we will focus on **MODIS land products**, but similar procedures can likely be followed for other products.
